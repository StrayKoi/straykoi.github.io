# What is this?
Hey there, you've discovered the code for my "website"; not that it was a secret in the first place ðŸ˜‰.

Tired of using Linktree, Carrd, and similar sites, I decided to make my own webpage. Why? More customization and freedom. It'd also be a waste to just let my self-taught web dev skills gather dust on the shelf. So a quick little challenge for me and fully functional and responsive web page was built!
